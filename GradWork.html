							<h2>Outline</h2>
							<p>Generative grammars can recursively transform something into something using a user defined set of rules, Originally this was used to create phrases, but this can be applied to level design. This way a level can be generated from a graph that represents a network of abstract level sections/player actions (e.g collecting an item, solving a puzzle, defeating a boss) and the level layout is ultimately defined by the sequence of gameplay elements that was generated.</p>
							<h2>literature study</h2>
							<p>The first step for this project is to create a literature study. I started by going as broad as possible with the topic finding uses for graph grammers in a pletera areas including: robot generation, architecture, 2d dungeon generation. This lead me to a lot of research papers which I am currently reading through.  </p>
