							<h3>The project</h3>
							<p>
								We are making an augmented reality game made for 2player versus.<br />
								The game gives each player a base that they have to defend. These bases are connected with a lane where you can send units over to attack the other person.
								You also have acces to a variety of turrets to boost your economy or bombard incoming units with explosives and missiles. The game ends when one player manages to destroy their opponents base.<br /><br />
								We are creating this game for mobile in the unity game engine.
							</p>
							<h3>My contribution so far</h3>
							<p>
								In the prototyping phase I was assigned to research microsoft azure spatial anchors and unit movements on lanes.<br /><br>
								Microsoft azure spatial anchors is the core requirement for the project assigned by our client. Anchors are used to store spatial data in the cloud.
								One user creates a spatial anchor and the other user connects via network to retrieve the anchor.
								When both users have the same spatial anchor, a scene is created around it so both users see the same scene.<br><br>
								The lane system allows units in our game to travel from their base to the enemy base.
								Lanes are split into 3 "sublanes". When units enter combat they stop moving, the unit walking behind the stopped unit can go stand on the left or right side of this unit.
