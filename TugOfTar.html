							<h2>The Project</h2>
							<p>
								I got assigned to a team of fellow students to create a client project.
								We where tasked to create an augmented reality game with two player versus.<br />
								The game gives each player a base that they have to defend. These bases are connected with a lane where you can send units over to attack the other person.
								You also have acces to a variety of turrets to boost your economy or bombard incoming units with explosives and missiles. The game ends when one player manages to destroy their opponents base.<br /><br />
								My team and I created this game for mobile in the unity game engine.

							<h3>Prototyping Phase</h3>
							<p>
								In the prototyping phase, I was assigned to research Microsoft azure spatial anchors and unit movements on lanes.<br /><br>
								Microsoft azure spatial anchors is the core requirement for the project assigned by our client. Anchors are used to store spatial data in the cloud.
								One user creates a spatial anchor and the other user connects via network to retrieve the anchor.
								When both users have the same spatial anchor, a scene is created around it so both users see the same scene.<br><br>
								The lane system allows units in our game to travel from their base to the enemy base.
								Lanes are split into 3 "sublanes". When units enter combat they stop moving, the unit walking behind the stopped unit can go stand on the left or right side of this unit.
							</p>
							<h3>Production Phase</h3>
							<p>
								When the production phase started I set the Microsoft azure spatial anchors up first.
								When this worked properly we could then really start working on the gameplay part of the game.
								I set up the initial lane system however due to some unforeseen issues with the system it had to be redesigned. 
								It went from a system where every unit raycasts to find their best location to a set of list that tracked which spots where taken and which where free.
								Then my main task became creating a MRTK floating menu system for the game.
								These menus allowed the player to spawn units and select their turrets.
								And my last major task was to create all the base turrets.
							</p>
							<h3>Polish Phase</h3>
							<p>
								The main thing I cleaned up was the setup of the game so you couldn’t get stuck in the initial menu. 
								The menu itself isn't too complex but the buttons should only be available when their corresponding part of the startup procedure is done.
